Billtab is a tool to collaboratively track and analyse expenses and earnings. The collaborative features are in development but the current version works well for personal use and offline.

Entries are currently locally stored on your system so that they can be available offline. This means you can download and host this on your local system. A hosted version, which also works offline, is available at [billtab.co](http://billtab.co/). No data is shared with the server.
